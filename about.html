        <h1>What is Bubble Tea?</h1>
        <p>Bubble tea can be traced back to the postwar period of Taiwan. Chang Fan Shu, a Taiwanese who worked in an
            izakaya during the Japanese colonial period, opened the Shuang Ch'üan tea shop in Tainan in 1949. He made
            the distinct shou yao (hand-shaken) tea by using cocktail shakers. Because this type of tea is soft and
            dense and has foam on the upper layer, it was later named bubble tea. However, this entertaining tea did
            not become popular in Taiwan until the 1980s during the economic miracle period of Taiwan. Artist and
            entrepreneur Tu Tsong He urgently needed to open a unique and creative tea shop after his hot pot restaurant
             went bankrupt in 1986. When walking to the market, Taiwanese Hokkien traditional dessert tapioca balls
             inspired him. Therefore, he add the tapioca balls to green tea. Given to the white appearance of the tapioca
             ball resembles his mother's pearl necklace, Tu named the tea item "Pearl Green Tea." The black pearl was
             invented in 1988 by Lin Hsiu Hui, the product manager of the tea shop Chun Shui Tang (spring water hall).
             For the purpose of increasing the commercial visibility, a vendor in Tainan named the tapioca ball after the
              famous Hong Kong sexy actress Amy Yip's nickname "Boba," which means huge breasts. In the 1990s, a large
              number of Taiwanese immigrants migrated to the west and east coasts of the United States and imported
              Taiwan's bubble tea culture. Today, bubble tea has developed into a culture that is not only unique to
              Taiwan, but also an international emerging culture.</p>

        <h1>The Story of Catayo</h1>
        <p>The name of Catayao is taken from the old name of the Minsheng (civil economic) community in Taipei, Taiwan,
            which is the hometown of this shop's founder Jy Haw "Hardy" Kwan. Hardy is studying in visual arts at UW Tacoma.
            In addition to painting and design, he is also interested in coding, movies, music, and history.
            Currenly, he is taking T INST 312 and was excited to learn web design knowledges, such as HTML, CSS, and PHP.
            Bubble tea shops were where he and his friends chatted from elementary school to high school.
            Catayo, which stands for teenage girls' hair accessories, was one of the tribes of the Basay people,
            the indigenous people of Taiwan, during 15th century to 17th century. Under the threat of Qing dynasty and
            Japanese colonial regimes, the Basay people were forced to abandon their national status.
            Although Basay’s culture is no longer valued today, Hardy insists on remembering his roots and creating
            his own brand. Catayo aims to share Basay history
            and promote Taiwan's unique bubble tea culture to the American people in the Northwest. In our shop, we provide
            high-quality, stylish, healthy, and innovative tea items. In order to fulfill our commitment to consumers, we
            also cooperate with tea farmers in Washington State and promote local tea. Like bubble tea shops in Taiwan,
            consumers at Catayo can choose different sweetness and temperature options according to their preferences.

        <h1>Supporting Local Tea Farm</h1>
        <p>Sakuma Brothers Farms is the only commercial tea grower located in the Skagit Valley in the Northwest. Richard Sakuma
             is the third-generation Japanese farmer of the Sakuma family. Sakuma Brothers Farms is named after Richard's father
             and uncle. They has grown strawberries in the area since 1935, and Richard decided to develop the tea business.
             Sakuma met John Vendeland, who was in the coffee and tea business, in 1997. Vendeland is a visionary and well-planned
              person. He yearns to create a tea industry in the Northwest based on Napa Valley mode. In his vision, the tea farms
              will have tasting rooms that will attract tea fans from cities in Western Washington and British Columbia. After
              growing tea in Willamette Valley, Oregon and experiencing the cold winter there, Vendelend came to Skagit Valley in
               Washington State. At the time, Vendelend needed experienced farmers, and Sakuma was looking for business partners.
             Therefore, they began to cooperate and plant 20 different varieties of tea on 5 acres of land. In the Skagit Valley
             greenhouse, Sakuma learns and checks the color and size of the leaves, the shape of the plants, and the health of
             different tea varieties. After years of trial, Sakuma participated in the Taiwan Oolong Tea study tour in June 2009.
             As a result of learning the history, cultivation methods, and flavor characteristics of oolong tea, the tea trees
             cultivated by Sakuma can produce green tea, oolong tea, or white tea.</p>
